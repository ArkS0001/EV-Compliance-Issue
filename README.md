# EV-Compliance-Issue
EV batteries, motors, and inverters must comply with rigorous safety standards (e.g. UL, IEC 61851/62196, ISO 26262 for functional safety). Battery certification (by bodies such as ARAI in India or UL in North America) is critical to prevent hazards like thermal runaway or short circuits.
